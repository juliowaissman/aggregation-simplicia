# A simple example of aggregation operators

Aggregation and fusion of information are basic concerns for all kinds of knowledge based systems. From a general point of view we can say that aggregation has for purpose the simultaneous use of different pieces of information in order to come to a conclusion or a decision. 

The aggregation operators are mathematical objects that have the function of reducing a set of numbers into a unique representative (or meaningful) number. A good explanation (as well as the more technical aspects) about aggregation operators can be found [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e035/2817767dea0a7cc9c9afda475f4f96cceb09.pdf).

This site aims to show and review the differences of 4 aggregation operators, which represent very different points of view. For this we assume that a group of 4 experts in an area are asked to evaluate different alternatives with a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the alternative is completely undesirable, a 1 means that it is a very desirable option.

For example, suppose you have information about a patient, and four doctors evaluate different action alternatives (eg surgery, some medication, noninvasive therapies, etc.). Each doctor evaluates the alternatives in a different way. If we consider that all doctors have the same experience, what should be the final decision?

In this site you can add or remove alternatives, review the final decision using different aggregation operators and compare the numerical results among the four simple operators used in this work.
