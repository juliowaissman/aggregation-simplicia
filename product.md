The conjunctive operators are all those such that:
$$
\min(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \ge F(x_1, \ldots, x_n).
$$

These operators (also known as T-norms) represent a very pesimistic position, since only a bad evaluation is necessary to consider the alternative as unfavorable, independently that other experts have made a good evaluation.

Among the disjunctive operators, one of the most used is the product between evaluations.
