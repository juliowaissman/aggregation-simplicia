The operators of average or consensus, are idempotent functions that
$$
\min(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \le F(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \le \max(x_1, \ldots, x_n).
$$

These operators represent a conservative point of view, where the evaluations in favor are offset by the evaluations against. It is the most common form of aggregation, where its main representative is the arithmetic mean.
